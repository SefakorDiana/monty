0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO

A group project done by Diana Sefakor Acquah and Ron Aryeetey in the monty language

The Monty language
Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.

Files which contain Monty byte codes often  have the .m extension.

Monty byte code files can contain blank lines (empty or made of spaces only, and any additional text after the opcode or its required argument is not taken into account

Allowed editors are vi, vim, emacs
Files are compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89
All the files end with a new line
There's a README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project
The codes are written in the betty style and can be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
